Installation
------------

Just drop the `index.php` and composer files in any folder accessible
through your web server with php interpreter, give it a `composer
install`, `mkdir db` with write permission for your web server
user/group and direct your browser to the former script.

For testing and debugging purposes, you can just use:

    $ php -S localhost:8000 index.php
